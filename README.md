### Hello and Welcome!  

My name is Matthew Baca, and I am a second year PhD students studying statistics at the University of Wisconsin.

I got my Bachelor of Science (BS) in Mathematics from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMT) and my Master of Science (MS) in Biostatistics from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.  After graduate for three years I worked for the Navy at China Lake, where I was doing statistical analysis and tool development in the world of Modeling and Simulation (M&S).

Currently my interest include: (1) Design of Experiments, (2) incorporating statistical rigor to the Verification and Validation (V&V) process, (3) time series analysis, (4) tool/software development, and (5) mixed effects/regression modeling.

Causal inference is a common term that I keep hearing about.  Other than "X causes Y" or "smoking causes cancer" I do not know much about causal inference.  I would like to learn more about causal inference because I am interested in its application to computer models and simulations.
